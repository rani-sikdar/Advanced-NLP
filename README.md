# Advanced Natural Language Processing Algorithms & Math ‚Äì Udemy Course 
This repository contains code implementations, mathematical derivations, and project notebooks from an Advanced NLP course on Udemy. It serves as a comprehensive companion to the course, covering a wide range of state-of-the-art NLP algorithms, techniques, and their mathematical foundations.

üîç What's Inside:
1. Tokenization, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

<!-- RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs and sequence modeling -->

<!--Attention Mechanism & Transformers-->

<!--BERT and other Transformer-based architectures-->

2. Text classification, summarization, translation & generation

3. Sequence-to-sequence models with attention

4. Mathematical deep dives into algorithms- Markov Model & assumption

5. Hands-on code for real-world NLP tasks

üß† Skills You'll Reinforce:
- Advanced Python for NLP

- Understanding of deep learning for text

- Mathematical intuition behind cutting-edge models

<!--Implementing models from scratch and using frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch -->

This repo is a work-in-progress as I go through the course. Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome!
